- Watch 'The Big Short' movie
- Bailouts. The 2008 Financial crisis was triggered by a financial instrument called mortgage-backend securities. Even though the banks at Wall Street were at fault, the govt ended up bailing them out using taxpayer money.
- You can't really trust a bank. Banks make money using the fractional reserve banking method where they lend out money in order to gain more capital. They would only keep a small fraction of the total money that people have deposited in the bank.

## Hashing
- It is a process of converting an input of any size into a fixed lenght output, called a hash.
- SHA-256 Hashing algo
- ```
  // a small piece of code that uses sha256 and creates a hash for the given input.
  
  const crypto = require('crypto');

  const input = "100xdevs";
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex');

  console.log(hash)
  ```

## Assignment 1
```
// find an input that gives the hash that starts with 00000

const crypto = require('crypto');

function findHashThatStartsWith(prefix) {
    let input = 0
    while (true) {
        let inputStr = input.toString();
        let hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(inputStr).digest('hex');

        if (hash.startsWith(prefix)) {
            return {input: inputStr, hash: hash}
        }
        input ++;
    }
}

// call
const result = findHashThatStartsWith('00000');

console.log(result);
```

## Assignment 2
```

// find an input that gives the hash that starts with 100xdevs

const crypto = require('crypto');

function findHashThatStartsWith(prefix) {
    let input = 0
    while (true) {
        let inputStr = "100xdevs"+input.toString();
        let hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(inputStr).digest('hex');

        if (hash.startsWith(prefix)) {
            return {input: inputStr, hash: hash}
        }
        input ++;
    }
}

// call
const result = findHashThatStartsWith('00000');

console.log(result);
```
